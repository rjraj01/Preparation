/* This program finds the number of binary trees given the length of the preorder sequence = n.
    A tree is an acyclic graph . A binary tree is a tree where each node has 0, 1 or 2 children. 
    Preorder traversal means traversing a tree in the following order : Root - Left child - Right child.  
    
    We use the dynamic programming approach where our root is fixed and the rest of the n-1 nodes
        are split as left and right children. Hence, we calculate the number of binary trees possible
        while exploring splits varying from 0 to n-1.
    
    Time Complexity - O(n^2)
    Space Complexity - O(n)
    
    Note:- The approach is similar to finding the nth catalan number.
